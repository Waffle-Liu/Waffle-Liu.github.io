Hi! I am a second-year Ph.D. student in the [Sound and Music Computing Lab](https://smcnus.comp.nus.edu.sg/) at [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/). I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Ye Wang](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/people/wangye/). My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and natural language processing. I am also broadly interested in machine learning for speech and music information retrieval. 

Previously, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) where I worked with Prof. [Kejun Zhang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/zhangkejun). I also spent a great semester in my senior year at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) and visited [CNMAT](https://cnmat.berkeley.edu/) where I worked with Prof. [Carmine Emanuele Cella](http://www.carminecella.com/). 



<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
