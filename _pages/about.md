<!-- Hi! I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the [Sound and Music Computing Lab](https://smcnus.comp.nus.edu.sg/) at [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/). I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Ye Wang](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/people/wangye/). My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and natural language processing. I am also broadly interested in machine learning for speech and music topics. 

Previously, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) where I worked with Prof. [Kejun Zhang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/zhangkejun). I also spent a great semester in my senior year at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) and visited [CNMAT](https://cnmat.berkeley.edu/) where I worked with Prof. [Carmine Emanuele Cella](http://www.carminecella.com/).  -->

<!-- I am broadly interested in machine learning for NLP, Speech, Multimodality topics.

I am broadly interested in machine learning for NLP and Multimodality topics. Currently, I focus more on improving LLMs and MLLMs from two directions: 

(1)**Multimodal Reasoning**: empowering LLMs with better language, speech, image, and video understanding and reasoning by designing data-efficient approaches; 

(2)**Trustworthy**: building trustworthy foundation models by investigating risks and enhancing the robustness and safety.
